# What is Easy-js?

Easy-js is a library that I built to help out new programmers and web developers who don't use Javascript that often. During my time
in school I found the Web Design program didn't put much focus on Javascript, and that is how I came up with the idea for Easy-js. With the help of 
code snippets and easy to use functions, Easy-js makes Javascript even easier to use!<br/> 

## Installation

`npm install easy-js`

## What's new in this version?
`v 0.1.8 brings 5* new functions with matching VSCode, Sublime and Atom code snippets!`<br/>
<br/>
`* The Control function has 17 methods that you can chain! `


## Documentation
The documentation for `Easy-JS` can be found at: [Easyjs.org](http://www.easyjs.org/doc).

## Included:

Easy.js - The main file that makes Javascript easy for new programmers and experts! <br/><br/>
javascript.json - This is a language.json file for VSCode, you will have to run this file manually to add in the code snippets that work with easy-js.<br/><br/>
EasyJS.sublime-snippet - This is the snippet file for Sublime Text users<br/><br/>
easy-js_snippets.cson - This is the code snippet file for Atom users.

## Usage:

To properly access the code snippets, make sure when you import/require the package that you call it: `ejs`
