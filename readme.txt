## What is Easy-js?

Easy-js is a library that I built to help out new programmers and web developers who don't use Javascript that often. During my time
in school I found the Web Design program didn't put much focus on Javascript, and that is how I came up with the idea for Easy-js. With the help of 
code snippets and easy to use functions, Easy-js makes Javascript even easier to use!<br/> 

## Installation

`npm install -g easy-js`

## What's new in this version?
`9 new functions and VSCode snippets!`

## Included:

Easy.js - The main file that makes Javascript easy for new programmers and experts! <br/><br/>
javascript.json - This is a language.json file for VSCode, you will have to run this file manually to add in the code snippets that work with easy-js.<br/><br/>
Sublime Text snippets will be coming in a future date!<br/><br/>

## Usage:

To properly access the code snippets, make sure when you import/require the package that you call it: `ejs`
